# Gene Sequence Prediction with Machine Learning
Pseudogene and other gene sequence predictions using a RNN and other architectures

Fall 2020 Research Project by: Haley Granger and Joe Tierno

# Our Implementation

We have three different implementations we explored for predicting pseudogenes with a RNN:<br />
-ExPecto Architecture (https://github.com/FunctionLab/ExPecto)<br />
-DanQ Architecture (https://github.com/uci-cbcl/DanQ)<br />
-RNN we created
